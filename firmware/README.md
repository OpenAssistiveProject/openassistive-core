OpenAssistive Firmware Module

This directory contains microcontroller-level firmware responsible for:

Real-time sensor data acquisition

Signal filtering and distance interpretation

Haptic feedback triggering logic

Communication with the compute unit (UART / USB / I2C)

Firmware must prioritize timing reliability, energy efficiency, and deterministic behavior.
